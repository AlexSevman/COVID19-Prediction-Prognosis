# Introduction

The COVID-19 disease has caused more than 1 million deaths in the world since its appearance at the end of 2019. Due to the serious consequences that this disease produced both for health and for social behavior, it has been become a disease of general interest, and therefore its study requires greater detail where being able to predict the prognosis of a patient is of the utmost importance.
According to the World Health Organization, this disease can be classified according to its symptoms, from very seriously ill, those who are hospitalized in intensive care with intubation (grade 1) to patients who do not present serious symptoms and are discharged after a few days. in the hospital (grade 5).


The disease is an immune dysfunction, involving both hyperimmune responses (activated inflammatory cascades, cytokine storm, tissue infiltrates) and hypoimmune responses (relative
lymphopenia, impaired T-cell function, impaired interferon [IFN]
antiviral responses and reduced viral clearance).

In turn, studying those conditions that can lead to a serious clinical picture would help to predict the prognosis and future actions regarding the care and treatment of the patient.

Therefore, it is proposed to investigate whether it is possible to generate a prediction model for the prognosis of this disease, from the first day the patient is admitted to hospital.

## Questions
**Problem to solve**

   - Classification of patients according to their symptoms and prediction of acute / adverse events according to the initial clinical picture.
   
**Proposed solution**
   - Generation of a machine learning model that predicts whether the patient will end up in a serious or non-serious state according to their initial pathology (day of admission)--> Logistic Regression
   - Generation of a machine learning model that indicates that it helps to decide the clinical picture of the patient --> Decision tree
